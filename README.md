# Fire Detection
## This project is designed to detect fire in images and videos using the YOLO v5 object detection model, developed on Google Colab.

# Project Overview
## The Fire Detection project utilizes YOLO v5, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to accurately and efficiently identify fire instances in visual data. The goal of this project is to assist in early fire ## detection by analyzing images or video feeds, which could be critical for safety measures in high-risk environments.

# Features
## Fire Detection: Detects fire in images and video streams using YOLO v5.
## Real-Time Processing: Processes video feeds in real-time for immediate detection.
## API Integration: Utilizes APIs for data input/output, enhancing accessibility and functionality

# Tech Stack
## Google Colab: Development environment.
## YOLO v5: Core object detection model for fire identification.
## Python: Programming language.
## APIs: For handling data exchange and expanding functionality.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
## A Google account to access Google Colab.
## Basic knowledge of Python and object detection.

# Installation
## !git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git
## !pip install -r yolov5/requirements.txt

# Usage
## Import necessary libraries and load YOLO v5.
## Run the fire detection code on images or video feeds.
## Use APIs for data retrieval and processing.

# Sample code to load YOLOv5 model and perform detection
## from yolov5 import detect
## results = detect(source='path_to_image_or_video')
## results.show()

# Contributing
## Contributions are welcome! Please create an issue or a pull request if you'd like to improve the project.
